The aim of this project was to create a Physically Based Renderer using Rust as the language and Vulkan as the API, unfortunately we were not able to achieve this goal, owing to a grave under-estimation about the complexity required to implement a photorealistic renderer in Vulkan, as well as a lack of relative experience in this specific subject, however we did succeed in creating a 3D raster engine instead, which was no small feat, considering the thousands of hours of programming and research it took to get to this point, despite the setback.

In the future, in order to better attempt to achieve this goal, we recommend one should temper their expectations about how much progress they would make in a given amount of time, and also potentially switching to a graphics API with a lower barrier of entry, such as OpenGL.
